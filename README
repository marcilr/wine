  Wine - Wine Is Not an Emulator

  Wine is a free and open source software application that aims to allow
  applications designed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems.
  Wine also provides a software library, known as Winelib, against which developers
  can compile Windows applications to help port them to Unix-like systems.
