Got quick Wine Warning window:
It appears that libnss-mdns is installed on your system,
but lib32nss-mdns is not.  Please note that Wine will not
able to access the Internet unless you either install 
lib32nss-mdns (or ia32-libss-mdns), or uninstall libnss-mdns.

Install the lib32nss-mdns package:
# aptitude install lib32nss-mdns
...
Unpacking lib32nss-mdns (from .../lib32nss-mdns_0.10-3.1_amd64.deb) ...
Setting up lib32nss-mdns (0.10-3.1) ...
